# incodoc

Incorporeal document format.
- document type that doesn't dictate appearance
- should be able to function like a static web page
- the consumer chooses how to render the document
- not meant to write directly but should be human readable and writable
- meant as a middle layer
  - documents written in formats easy for humans
  - converted to incodoc
  - served to consumers as an incodoc
  - either converted or rendered to best serve the consumer
- alternative to static site generators
  - emphasis on the consumer needs

## Quick example.

``` incodoc
props {
    ("date", 9999/12/31),
    ("language", "en"),
},
nav {
    snav {
        "top level",
        link {
            "/home",
            "home",
        },
        link {
            "/about",
            "about",
        },
        link {
            "/now",
            "now",

            let mut x = 0;
            let y = &mut x;
            let z = &mut x;
            *y = 1;
        ',
    },
    'Your viewer may try to run it, only if they wants to.

    code {

## Existing document formats

Could be HTML but in practice it is deeply involved with style.
Markdown is an incorporeal document.
The renderer, thus the user, chooses the font, colours, layout, etc.
Markdown is a successful incorporeal document.
