# incodoc

Incorporeal document experiment.
A document type that doesn't dictate appearance.
Could be HTML but in practice it is deeply involved with style.
Markdown is an incorporeal document.
The renderer, thus the user, chooses the font, colours, layout, etc.
Markdown is successful incorporeal document.
I want something like but with the ability to function like a static web page.

    - [home](/home)
    - [about](/about)
    - [now](/now)
    - [blog](/blog/index)
  $nav "other articles"
    - [I like cheese](cheese)
    - [Sosig is happiness](sosig)
